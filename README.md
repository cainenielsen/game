# bugs

if the player is holding the jump button, when tney fall off the map they appear below the tiles near the starting place.

When walking up against a block, the player will get stuck until they jump

players can maneuver through the bottom of blocks

the player appears to vibrate when attempting to move off the side of the map

the player is not limited to falling above the map

the player is able to get stuck on the side of blocks where they are then able to jump

the player can hold down the jump button to continuously jump (which could be a feature but should be able to be controlled)
