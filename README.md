## bugs

if the player is holding the jump button, when they fall off the map they appear below the tiles near the starting place.


the player appears to vibrate when attempting to move off the side of the map

the player is not limited to falling above the map

the player can hold down the jump button to continuously jump (which could be a feature but should be able to be controlled)

## tasks

build an upgraded in container checker

hit box visualization tools

delay on death

death at bottom of screen

code comments

balance out player movement

make the game non-zoom-able

make it possible for non-moving tiles to have collisions

fix the unique names in classes that toggle event listeners

## features

toggling pause with a key (esc, e?)

long more full map

more block types

showing the player direction while moving

double/infinite jump

bouncing/grappling

enemies

delay on death/death screen

music

coins

## research

when using classes in js is it best to use multiple listeners for events when extending multiple layers?
